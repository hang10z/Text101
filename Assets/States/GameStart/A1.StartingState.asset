  storyText: "The cold drip of water on your brow awakens you, the drops slam against
    your head and sound like a hammer against sheet metal.  You feel a sore, nagging,
    tugging pain from your knee.  Your head is heavy and you feel as though you have
    40000 lbs of weight on your chest.  Your eyes slowly grow acustomed to the dim
    light, and you notice a rat is chewing on your shoe lace.  You quickly try to
    kick the rat away but you cannot move your legs..  \n\nWithin reach you see a
    pencil and a leftover ham sandwich, what do you do?\n\n1. Grab the pencil\n2.
    Make use of the Ham Sandwich."
